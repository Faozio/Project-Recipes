    <h3>Easy Homemade Ukwa</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Ukwa is such a versatile food with a natural delicious flavour. It can be cooked plain without any ingredient, not even salt and it will taste great especially when prepared with fresh Ukwa. It can be roasted and eaten with coconut or palm kernel. It can also be prepared as a porridge which is what this page is about.
            Below are a list of ingredients you would need:</em>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>700g African Breadfruit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 medium dry fish</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 small stock cubes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>7g edible potash</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Palm oil (enough to colour)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>5-6 fresh bitter leaves</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Pepper & Salt (to taste)</li></strong>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Before cooking, wash the ukwa thoroughly in cold water this is because stones and sand usually settle at the bottom so watch out for those. Additionally pound the pepper and rinse the bitter leaves and set aside. Once done, follow the instructions below:</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the thoroughly washed ukwa in a sizeable pot. I used a pressure pot in the video below because it cooks the ukwa much faster.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water to cover the ukwa. The level of water should be about 1 inch above the level of the ukwa.</li>
            <li>Add the edible potash. Add the dry fish or stock fish, cover the pot and cook till well done. The ukwa is done when the seeds melt when pressed. You may need to top up the water while cooking so watch it closely. If using a pressure pot, top ups will not be necessary.</li>
            <li>Add enough palm oil to the well done ukwa, add pepper, stock cubes and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir. Cover and cook on medium heat till the palm oil changes colour from red to yellow. This should take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir and add the bitter leaves.</li>
            <li>Cover and leave to simmer or till the leaves wilt but still green and the ukwa is ready to be served.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Breadfruit Porridge gets thicker as it cools down so ensure you have enough porridge in the meal when done.
        Serve with chilled palmy or any other chilled drink. Enjoy
