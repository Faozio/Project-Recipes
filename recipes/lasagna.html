    <h3>Easy Homemade Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
        <em>All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!
        A quick overview of the layers:</em>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li><strong>Meat Sauce:</strong> Meat Sauce Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer Together:</strong> Layer Together Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and cheeses, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
            <li>Top the noodles with some of the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan and bake another 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Baking time lasagna for this recipe is about one hour total. To get that perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages:</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Layer, cover it tightly in foil to retain the moisture.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and your easy lasagna is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine).</li>
            <li>This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut.</li>
            <li>Resting is not required when reheating.</li>
        </ol>
